This is a short story about the journey of Hernán Cortés de Monroy y Pizarro who conquer the Aztecs and his notorious history with a great mindset about fear.

Back in 1519, when Hernán Cortés de Monroy y Pizarro arrived in the great Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán. With eleven ships who transports five hundred soldiers and three hundred civilians, Cortes’ goal was to head inland, claim the land, and steal whatever gold and silver they could get their hands on.

This capital was led by the powerful king Moctezuma. Cortés’ crew had only a few horses and weapons. Cortés knew that the crew who faced their first battle would be tempted to leave the coast with the ships. He ordered his officers to set the ships on fire the ships—Spanish galleons and caravels—made entirely of wood. Eventually they burned and sank to the water.

Cortés shows that we may feel brave and tireless when we face the journey with no option to escape from the problem and avoid acting driven by our fear. Cortes wanted the crew to go forward and don't act on their fear.

This history was getting me into a new approach to self-control, we might think about all distractions which sabotage us when we want to accomplish or reach our goals. But, the reason we tempt to avoid the pain and try to escape from the problem is the option that we have. By eliminating the options to escape and face the pain and keep going forward, we won’t act by our fear and with this notorious story I find out that we probably feel brave when we have no option to escape and desperately endeavor to reach our goal with no excuse to give up.
